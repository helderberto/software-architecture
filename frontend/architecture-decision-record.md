## Technical Details

### Architecture Impact

```typescript
// Example of architectural changes
interface NewArchitecture {
  component: {
    name: string;
    type: 'atomic' | 'composite';
    dependencies: string[];
  };
  state: {
    scope: 'local' | 'global';
    management: 'redux' | 'context' | 'signals';
  };
}
```
